          <h2>Wheat</h2>
          <p>
            Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the
            crop is about 29.8 million hectares in the country. The production
            of wheat in the country has increased significantly from 75.81
            million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88 million MT
            in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in
            2004-05 has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major
            increase in the productivity of wheat has been observed in the
            states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher area coverage is
            reported from MP in recent years. Indian wheat is largely a
            soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat
            similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western
            India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten content.
            India also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat,
            mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian durum is not
            marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.
            However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a
            price premium, mainly for processing of higher value/branded
            products. The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite
            low, when India became independent in 1947. The production of Wheat
            was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity was merely 663 kg per
            hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the Indian
            population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for
            fulfilling the needs of our people from many countries like USA
            under PL-480. The reasons of low production and productivity of
            Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant habit resulting in
            lodging, when grown under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering and
            low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility
            to diseases, (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo & photo
            variations, etc., resulting in poor adaptability, and (e) longer
            crop duration resulting in a long exposure of plants to the climatic
            variations and insect pest / disease attacks. The Government of
            India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of
            increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological
            conditions. As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the
            Wheat scenario in our country has completely changed. In the post
            Independence era, country used to import Wheat for our needs but due
            to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in
            the 'Green Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became
            self dependent in Wheat production. At present, country is producing
            much more excess Wheat than the requirement and Godowns are
            over-flooded with Wheat.
          </p>

          <h2>Climate requirement</h2>
          <p>
            Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the
            tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and
            the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north
            altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth
            with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated
            from sea level to as high as 3300 meters. The best wheat are
            produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major
            portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to
            enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range
            for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can
            germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after
            sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with
            a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing. During the
            heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures
            and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity
            and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant
            requires about 14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of
            ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling
            and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c
            during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures
            are high, too much energy I lost through the process of
            transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results
            in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi
            (winter) season crop in India.
          </p>

          <h2>Soil</h2>
          <p>
            Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay
            loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding
            capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to
            avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should be
            neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable
            for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and
            retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor
            drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging.
            Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their
            water and nutrient holding capacity are improved. Fertilizer
            management The time and placement of fertilizer is another area
            where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated that 120 kg
            nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were
            required for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two
            split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first
            irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal.
            Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha
            with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains,
            application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to
            increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has
            been found beneficial for enhancing the productivity as well as the
            grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the
            Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has
            also been realized. Nutrient management With intensive agriculture,
            deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread. The
            work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on
            Micronutrient in Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency
            of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the deficiency
            level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 %
            and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been reported across
            a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been
            obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds
            and pulses etc. To realize the potential yield, strategies may
            include Site specific nutrient management for targeted yields
            Integration of crop residues, bio fertilizers etc with inorganic
            fertilization Tillage techniques like FIRBS for increasing nutrient
            use efficiencies Remote sensing for efficient Nutrient management

          <h2>Maize</h2>
          <p>
            Maize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops
            having wider adaptability under varied agro-climatic conditions.
            Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has the
            highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated
            on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider diversity of
            soil, climate, biodiversity and management practices that
            contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the global grain production. The
            United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of maize
            contributes nearly 35 % of the total production in the world and
            maize is the driver of the US economy. The USA has the highest
            productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1 ) which is double than the global average
            (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the average productivity in India is 2.43 t
            ha-1
          </p>
          <p>
            In India, maize is the third most important food crops after rice
            and wheat. According to advance estimate its production is likely to
            be 22.23 M Tonnes (2012-13) mainly during Kharif season which covers
            80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9 % in the national
            food basket. In addition to staple food for human being and quality
            feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an
            ingredient to thousands of industrial products that includes starch,
            oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical,
            cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maize is cultivated throughout the year in all states of the
            country for various purposes including grain, fodder, green cobs,
            sweet corn, baby corn, pop corn in peri-urban areas. The predominant
            maize growing states that contributes more than 80 % of the total
            maize production are Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %), Karnataka (16.5 %),
            Rajasthan (9.9 %), Maharashtra (9.1 %), Bihar (8.9 %), Uttar Pradesh
            (6.1 %), Madhya Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %). Apart
            from these states maize is also grown in Jammu and Kashmir and
            North-Eastern states. Hence, the maize has emerged as important crop
            in the non-traditional regions i.e. peninsular India as the state
            like Andhra Pradesh which ranks 5th in area (0.79 m ha) has recorded
            the highest production (4.14 m t) and productivity (5.26 t ha-1 ) in
            the country although the productivity in some of the districts of
            Andhra Pradesh is more or equal to the USA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from
            loamy sand to clay loam. However, soils with good organic matter
            content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are
            considered good for higher productivity. Being a sensitive crop to
            moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity
            stresses; it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor
            drainage and also the field having higher salinity. Therefore, the
            fields having provision of proper drainage should be selected for
            cultivation of maize.
          </p>
          <p>
            All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on maize was launched
            in 1957 with the objective to develop and disseminate genetically
            superior cultivars and production/protection technologies. AICRP
            organizes interdisciplinary, interinstitutional, co-operative and
            systematic testing of newly developed cultivars of both public and
            private sectors for different agro-climatic zones of the country.
            The project resulted in refining efforts in varietal improvement.
            Since 1961, a total number of 187 cultivars including single cross
            hybrids, composites and multiple parent crosses have been released
            nationwide. In India, maize is traditionally grown in monsoon
            (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature (35° C)
            and rainfall. However, with the development of new cultivars and
            appropriate production technology, winter cultivation of maize has
            emerged as a viable alternative.

          <h2>Rice</h2>
          <p>
            Oryza Sativa, it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate,
            though it is not a tropical plant. It is probably a descendent of
            wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the
            far Eastern Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the
            rice plant may have originated in southern India, then spread to the
            north of the country and then onwards to China. It then arrived in
            Korea, the Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and
            Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.).
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey of rice around the world has been slow, but once it took
            root it stayed and became a major agriculture and economic product
            for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of
            the cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very
            essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts
            of India. In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent,
            where wheat is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked
            daily as well as on festivals and special occasions.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Rice</h2>
          <p>
            in India India is an important centre of rice cultivation. The rice
            is cultivated on the largest areas in India. Historians believe that
            while the indica variety of rice was first domesticated in the area
            covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern
            India), stretching through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and
            Southern China, the japonica variety was domesticated from wild rice
            in southern China which was introduced to India. Perennial wild rice
            still grow in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400
            BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains.
            It then spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers.
            Some says that the word rice is derived from the Tamil word arisi.
          </p>
          <h2>Climatic Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude
            and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN
            latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop
            needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which
            have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of
            water. The average temperature required throughout the life period
            of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can
            tolerate 400C to 42 0C.
          </p>
          <h2>Nutritional value of Rice</h2>
          <p>
            Rice is a nutritional staple food which provides instant energy as
            its most important component is carbohydrate (starch). On the other
            hand, rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average
            composition of these substances being only 8 per cent and fat
            content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to this
            reason it is considered as a complete food for eating. Rice flour is
            rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is
            also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt.
            Likewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce
            porcelain, glass and pottery. Rice is also used in manufacturing of
            paper pulp and livestock bedding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The variability of composition and characteristics of rice is really
            broad and depends on variety and environmental conditions under
            which the crop is grown. In husked rice, protein content ranges in
            between 7per cent to 12per cent. The use of nitrogen fertilizers
            increases the percentage content of some amino acids.
          </p>
          <h2>Medicinal Value</h2>
          <p>
            The immense diversity of rice germplasm is a rich source for many
            rice based products and is also used for treating many health
            related maladies such as indigestion, diabetes, arthritis,
            paralysis, epilepsy and give strength to pregnant and lactating
            mothers. Ancient Ayurvedic literature testify the medicinal and
            curative properties of different types of rice grown in India.
            Medicinal rice varieties like Kanthi Banko (Chhattisgarh), Meher,
            Saraiphul & Danwar (Orissa), Atikaya & Kari Bhatta (Karnataka), are
            very common in India. Few varieties cultivated in restricted pockets
            of Kerala for their medical properties e.g. Chennellu, Kunjinellu,
            Erumakkari & Karuthachembavu etc.
          </p>
          <h2>Crop Production Practices</h2>
          <p>
            In India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i)
            uplands and (ii) low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a
            particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of
            land, type of soils, irrigation facilities, availability of
            labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice
            is grown with the following methods Dry or Semi-dry upland
            cultivation Broadcasting the seed Sowing the seed behind the plough
            or drilling Wet or lowland cultivation Transplanting in puddled
            fields. Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.
          </p>
          <h2>Selection of Seeds</h2>
          <p>
            The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important
            factor to get better crop yield. Therefore, proper care has to be
            taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in
            raising the healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds
            intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements The
            seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be
            grown. The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of
            other seeds. The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in
            size. The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad
            storage. The seed should have a high germinating capacity. Before
            sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the
            seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.
          </p>

          <h2>Pulses</h2>
          <p>
            Pulses are consumed as Dal, which is a cheap source of plant
            protein. These are consumed because of body building properties
            having presence of various amino acids. These also have medicinal
            properties. By products of pulses like leaves, pod coats and bran
            are given to animals in the form of dry fodder. Some pulse crops
            like Gram, Lobia, Urdbean & Moongbean are fed to animals as green
            fodder. Moong plants are also used as green manure which improve
            soil health and adds nutrient into the soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of pulse crops are grown in India and world. Among the
            crops, major ones are Gram, Pigeonpea, Lentil, Fieldpeas etc.
            According to history, the origin of Gram is in South West Asia –
            probably Afghanistan and Persia, Pigeonpea in Africa, Lentil in
            Turkey to South Iran and Fieldpeas in Mediterranean Region of
            Southern Europe and Western Asia.
          </p>
          <h2>Important Major Pulses Growing Zones / States in India</h2>
          <p>
            Varietal Development programme of pulses got strengthened in 1967
            with the initiation of All-India Co-ordinated Research Improvement
            Programme. Through this programme, the varieties suitable for across
            the country i.e. agro-climatic zones: Northern Hills Zone – J&K,
            Himachal Pradesh, North West of Uttar Pradesh; North West Plain Zone
            – Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, western Uttar Pradesh; North
            East Plain Zone – eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam,
            Tripura, Mizoram, Northern Odisha; Central Zone – Madhya Pradesh,
            Maharashtra, Parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh; South Zone – Andhra
            Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and southern Odisha have been
            developed.
          </p>
          <h2>Climatic Requirement</h2>
          <p>
            Pulse crops are cultivated in Kharif, Rabi and Zaid seasons of the
            Agricultural year. Rabi crops require mild cold climate during
            sowing period, during vegetative to pod development cold climate and
            during maturity / harvesting warm climate. Similarly, Kharif pulse
            crops require warm climate throughout their life from sowing to
            harvesting. Summer pulses are habitants of warm climate. Seed is
            required to pass many stages to produce seed like germination,
            seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruit setting, pod development and
            grain maturity / harvesting.

            There was 239 lakh ha area in India at triennium ending 2010-11,
            which was mainly contributed by Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
            Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. From this area, 158 lakh
            tonnes production of pulse was received. The major contributors of
            this production were Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh,
            Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. During this period, productivity of
            pulses was recorded as 661 kg / ha with highest in Punjab (905

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Jute</h2>
          <p>
            Jute is an important natural fibre crop in India next to cotton. In
            trade and industry, jute and mesta crop together known as raw jute
            as their uses are almost same. Raw jute plays an important role in
            the country’s economy. Raw jute was originally considered as a
            source of raw material for packaging industries only. But it has now
            emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such
            as, textile industries, paper industries, building and automotive
            industries, use as soil saver, use as decorative and furnishing
            materials, etc. Raw jute being bio-degradable and annually renewable
            source, it is considered as an environment-friendly crop and it
            helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance.
            Further attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability,
            inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate. Moreover, it
            can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibres.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although Jute acreage has stabilized around 8 lakh hectares in the
            country, jute productivity has more than doubled to 22.12 q/ha in
            2010-11 since partition of the country from 11 qtl per ha and the
            total production of raw jute in the country is about 10.58 million
            bales of 180 kg each. This has happened due to development of short
            duration high yielding varieties as well as other production
            technologies by ICAR including fertilizer management, weed
            management, farm machineries and pest management. CRIJAF (ICAR) has
            developed around 15 high yielding varieties of jute and allied
            fibres.
          </p>

          <p>
            Production and distribution of certified seed of newly released
            varieties are the need of the hour for further improvement in
            productivity. ICAR has taken the initiatives for production of
            quality seed of newly released varieties of jute in its farms which
            may increase the yield by at least 20-30%. Five most important
            issues namely, improvement in productivity, quality improvement,
            retting of jute, farm machineries and quality seed production are
            addressed by the ICAR through various on-going projects, which have
            contributed to the present level of production with adequate support
            from the Jute Technology Mission and Directorate of Jute Development
            of the Ministry of Agriculture.
          </p>

          <p>
            With its insignificant coverage of total cultivated area, it plays a
            predominant role in the country’xs economy by generating employment,
            earning foreign exchange, solving many of the socio-economic
            problems, etc. In earlier years, Jute was considered as a Golden
            Fibre but there after it had to pass through different critical
            situation. The main problem came in the way with the introduction of
            synthetic fibre by the end of sixties/early seventies. After the
            development of diversified product of jute fibre and due to growing
            concern about the environment pollution, the importance of jute has
            again revived.
          </p>

          <h2>Important regions/ zones for Jute cultivation in India</h2>
          <p>
            Jute cultivation is mainly concentrated in the eastern and north
            eastern India while that of mesta cultivation is spread almost
            throughout the country. The crop can be grown in low, medium and
            high land situation, both moisture stress and water stagnating
            condition. White Jute can be grown comparatively in low land
            situation while that of Tossa Jute prefers medium and high land
            situation. Mesta is grown in almost all over the country. It being a
            hardy crop and can tolerate moisture stress; its cultivation is
            spread in different agro-climatic situations unlike jute which is
            concentrated only in eastern and north eastern States. In a major
            part of Jute area, particularly in North Bengal, Bihar and
            North-Eastern States, the soil is acidic in nature. However, the
            Jute crop is growing in these areas in existing situation adjusting
            the crop sequence.

          <h2>Sugarcane</h2>

          <p>
            Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) family Gramineae (Poaceae) is
            widely grown crop in India. It provides employment to over a million
            people directly or indirectly besides contributing significantly to
            the national exchequer. Sugarcane growing countries of the world lay
            between the latitude 36.7° north and 31.0° south of the equator
            extending from tropical to subtropical zones. Sugar cane originated
            in New Guinea where it has been known for thousands of years. Sugar
            cane plants spread along human migration routes to Asia and the
            Indian subcontinent. Here it cross-bred with some wild sugar cane
            relatives to produce the commercial sugar cane we know today.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cultivation of sugarcane in India dates back to the Vedic period.
            The earliest mention of sugarcane cultivation is found in Indian
            writings of the period 1400 to 1000 B.C. It is now widely accepted
            that India is the original home of Saccharum species. Saccharum
            barberi and Polynesian group of island especially New Guinea is the
            centre of origin of S. officinarum. It belongs to family Gramineae
            (Poaceae), class monocotyledons and order glumaceae sub family
            panicoidae, tribe Andripogoneae and sub tribe saccharininea. The
            cultivated canes belong to two main groups: (a) thin, hardy north
            Indian types S.barberi and S.Sinense and (b) thick, juicy noble
            canes Saccharum officinarum. Highly prized cane is S. officinarum.

          <h2>Important regions/ zones for sugarcane cultivation in India</h2>

          <p>
            Broadly there are two distinct agro-climatic regions of sugarcane
            cultivation in India, viz., tropical and subtropical. However, five
            agro-climatic zones have been identified mainly for the purpose of
            varietal development. They are (i)North Western Zone (ii) North
            Central Zone (iii) North Eastern Zone (iv) Peninsular Zone (v)
            Coastal Zone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tropical region Shared about 45% and 55% of the total sugarcane area
            and production in the country, respectively along with the average
            productivity of 77 t/ha (2011-12). Sub-tropical region accounted for
            about 55% and 45% of total area and production of sugarcane with an
            average productivity about 63 t/ha (2011-12)
          </p>

          <h2>Tropical Sugarcane region</h2>

          <p>
            The tropical sugarcane region consists of sugarcane agro climatic
            zone 4 (peninsular zone) and 5(Coastal zone) which includes the
            states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,
            Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Pondicherry and Kerala.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sub-tropical sugarcane region: Around 55 per cent of total cane area
            in the country is in the sub-tropics. U.P, Bihar, Haryana and Punjab
            comes under this region. Crop distribution: Sugarcane growing
            countries of the world are lying between the latitude 36.70 north
            and 31.00 south of the equator extending from tropical to
            sub-tropical zones. In India sugarcane is cultivated all over the
            country from latitude 80 N to 330 N, except cold hilly areas like
            Kashmir valley, Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.
          </p>

          <h2>Climatic requirement</h2>

          <p>
            Temperature for different critical stages of sugarcane: The
            different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth,
            active growth and elongation. Optimum temperature for sprouting
            (germination) of stem cuttings is 32° to 38°c. It slows down below
            25°, reaches plateau between 30°-34°. Temperatures above 38° reduce
            the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration. For ripening,
            however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12° to 14° are
            desirable.
          </p>

          <h2>Reduction in yield of sugarcane due to rise in temperature</h2>

          <p>
            The sugarcane productivity and juice quality are profoundly
            influenced by weather conditions prevailing during the various
            crop-growth sub-periods. Sugar recovery is highest when the weather
            is dry with low humidity; bright sunshine hours, cooler nights with
            wide diurnal variations and very little rainfall during ripening
            period. These conditions favour high sugar accumulation. The
            climatic conditions like very high temperature or very low
            temperature deteriorate the juice quality and thus affecting the
            sugar quality. Favourable climate like warm and humid climate favour
            the insect pests and diseases, which cause much damage to the
            quality and yield of its juice and finally sucrose contents.

          <h2>About Fruits</h2>
          <p>
            Karnataka state implements several schemes for the benefit of farmers. Farmers undertake different
            agriculture and agriculture related activities like growing Agriculture crops, Horticulture crops,
            Sericulture, Dairy, Poultry, Fishery etc. Each of this activity requires specialised knowledge and
            experience. Therefore, the state has established specialised and specific department to assist farmers in
            carrying out farming activities effectively and efficiently. While establishment of exclusive departments
            brings focused approach for development of each of these activities, farmers need to approach different
            departments for availing any type of assistance and benefits. It is common practice that all the departments
            seek documents from the farmers for providing benefits under any scheme. Farmers end up submitting same set
            of documents to different departments every year. Sometimes they will be required to submit one set of
            documents for every scheme in same department.
            A well organized and scrutinized farmer database will avoid farmers from running pillar to post for availing
            benefits. Besides it would helps the departments in overcoming the aforesaid issues. DPAR e Governance
            department in association with NIC has developed a software application called Farmer Registration &Unified
            Beneficiary Information System – FRUITS.
